\section{Question 1}
[35\%] The TOP 500 is a widely recognized organization that lists the 500 
supercomputers with the most performance in terms of absolute computational 
rate and computational efficiency. Please visit the TOP 500 website: 
\texttt{http://www.top500.org/} and navigate through the site to learn about 
TOP 500.

\begin{enumerate}

\item
\begin{description}
\item[Q: ]According to what the performance is measured? How often the 
rank is updated?
\item[A:]The performance is measured by their performance on the LINPACK 
Benchmark. The rank is updated twice a year.
\end{description}

\item
\begin{description}
\item[Q: ]Plot the performance of the fastest supercomputer vs time since 
1993. What can you comment on this plot?
\item[A: ]According to Fig.\ref{fig:fatest}, 
\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}
the computing speed doubled roughly every 18 months, following 
the \textbf{Moore's Law}.
\end{description}

\item
\begin{description}
\item[Q: ]Using the statistics tool, generate plots for Architecture, 
Processor Architecture, Processor Family and Number of Processors over 
time. Make conclusions about the progress in these characteristics. 
Where are going the supercomputers according to these characteristics? 
Explain briefly.
\item[A: ]Plots listed as below:

\end{figure}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!]

		\caption{\label{fig:proc-arch-share}Processor Family Share Over Time 1993-2009}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth, angle=0]{proc-num-share.png}
		\caption{\label{fig:proc-num-share}Number of Processors Share Over Time 1993-2009}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}
As the development of Super Computers, Cluster began to dominate the architecture, and most
of the processors were scaler based. What's more, Intel EM64T began to dominate the processor
market in the recent years. The number of processors of one super computer bumped dramatically 
in the recent years.
